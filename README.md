## Description
This dataset is a curated subset of Smule's DAMP dataset (without audio files). It consists of 4 songs, each sung by 100 singers, so a total of 400 singing renditions. The songs were evaluated for their singing quality through a crowd-sourcing platform, where measures were taken to ensure quality of rating.
A detailed description of the way this dataset was curated and the human annotation collection procedure are discussed in the following paper. Please cite this paper if you happen to use this dataset for your research. Thanks!
